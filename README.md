## Overview

This accelerator provides Zoom Contact Center clients with a quick and easy way to securely access Shopify customer and order data, enabling personalised customer experience, self-serve/contact deflection, and advisor efficiency for all contact channels.

Once installed, the accelerator provides clients with the ability to implement multiple CX use cases, such as pre-emptive intent detection; personalised messaging; self-serve of common contact queries such as “_where is my order?_”, “_my order is missing an item_”, “_where is my refund?_”; automated Identity and Verification (ID&V), and priority routing for high value customers. This provides customers with an effortless experience, and advisors with the context of the customer as soon as they connect to the conversation, contributing towards faster handling times and improved first contact resolution.
